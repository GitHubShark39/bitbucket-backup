# Bitbucket Backup

Bitbucket Backup is a backup tool which backups all your [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) repositories to your local machine.


## How to build

Just run **build.bat** in the main folder. This will create a new folder named **release** with the compiled exe.


## Setup

Bitbucket Backup loads all important values (your Bitbucket username and password, and the backup folder on your local machine) from a config file.
Before you run Bitbucket Backup the first time, you need to edit **BitbucketBackup.exe.config** and provide your data.
