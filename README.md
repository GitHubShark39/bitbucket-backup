# Bitbucket Backup

Bitbucket Backup is a backup tool which backups all your [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) repositories to your local machine.

## Setup

Bitbucket Backup loads all important values (your Bitbucket username and password, and the backup folder on your local machine) from a config file.
Before you run Bitbucket Backup the first time, you need to provide your data.

An example configuration file is included. You can find it here:
**\\src\\BitbucketBackup\\App.config.example**

You need to make a copy of this, change the name to **App.config** and edit the configuration values.
